It aims at analysing 12 months’ worth of sales data containing hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. During the course of this project I was able to analyse the data and answer some real-life sales problems like :
1.What was the best month for sales and how much revenue was generated that month?
2.Which city sold the maximum product?
3.What time should the store display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
4.What products are most often sold together?
5.What product sold the most?
